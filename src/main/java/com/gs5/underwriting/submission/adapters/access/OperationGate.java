/**
 * The only door to an operation. It admits a caller, or refuses it before any input is parsed.
 *
 * <p>Two type parameters, as the product owner decided. The refusal type is always
 * {@link AccessRefusal}, so search's {@code switch} has a {@code PermissionDenied} arm that can
 * never run. A test proves it never runs, because the type no longer does.
 *
 * <p>The operation can run only through the {@link Admission} that {@link #admit} returns, so an
 * unauthorised caller's input is never examined by our code. The constructor is public only so
 * configuration can build a gate.
 *
 * <p><strong>RED stub.</strong> {@link #admit} returns {@code null}; pinned by
 * {@code OperationGateTest}.
 *
 * @param <C> the raw input the operation receives after admission
 * @param <R> the operation's result
