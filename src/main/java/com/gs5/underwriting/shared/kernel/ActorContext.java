 * material still shows were <em>removed from the JDK in 24</em>; the final API is
 * {@code ScopedValue.where(KEY, value).call(op)}. These two methods wrap it so no caller has to
 * remember which form is current, and a Checkstyle rule fails the build on the removed one.
 *

 * @param actorId  stable identifier of the caller, written to audit fields
