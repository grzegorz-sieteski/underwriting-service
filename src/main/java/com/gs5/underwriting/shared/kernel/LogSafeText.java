/**
 * Renders caller-supplied text inert before it reaches a log line or an RFC 7807
 * {@code ProblemDetail}, without redacting any of it.
 *
 * <p><strong>Writing an unescaped control character into a log line is log injection.</strong> A
 * value containing NEWLINE, written raw, forges what reads as an additional log entry; one
 * containing NUL truncates an entry; one containing a terminal escape sequence can manipulate
 * whoever reads the log. That hazard is reachable precisely where such values are being
 * <em>refused</em> — the refusal path is the one place they are guaranteed to appear — so the
 * escaping has to live on the path that reports them.
 *
 * <p><strong>This is escaping, not masking.</strong> Nothing is hidden and nothing is dropped: a
 * TAB becomes the six readable characters {@code \u0009}, which is both inert and strictly more
 * informative than an invisible character. That is what lets a number stay loggable in full
 * (BR-23) while a refusal about its characters (BR-29) cannot be turned into log forgery. A value
 * that must not be disclosed at all is masked instead, at its own record, and the two mechanisms
 * are deliberately separate.
 *
 * <p>It lives in the shared kernel because {@code domain/}, {@code query/} and {@code adapters/}
 * all need it and {@code query/} may not import {@code domain/}. Escaping belongs to no one module,
 * and three private copies of it would be three places for the category to drift.
